# Game Theory Beyond the Book

## Introductions

This repository accompanies WDSS/EconSoc's talk Game Theory Beyond the Book ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9di7mvPsnw)/[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHY4dJY01wc)). We would strongly recommend you watching this first.

## Example Notebooks

We will gradually be releasing example notebooks showcasing how you can write game theoretic strategies in Python, taking advantage of our helpers and simple interface. So far, we have released the following tutorials:

- [Basic Strategies](https://colab.research.google.com/github/warwickdatascience/game-theory-beyond-the-book/blob/main/examples/basic.ipynb)
- [Submissions Rules](https://colab.research.google.com/github/warwickdatascience/game-theory-beyond-the-book/blob/main/examples/rules.ipynb)
- [Managing Game/Player State](https://colab.research.google.com/github/warwickdatascience/game-theory-beyond-the-book/blob/main/examples/state.ipynb)
- [Broadcasting Strategies](https://colab.research.google.com/github/warwickdatascience/game-theory-beyond-the-book/blob/main/examples/broadcasting.ipynb)
- Developing Trust (Coming Soon)
- Finite and Infinite Games (Coming Soon)

These all run in Google Colab so you don't need to install anything.

## Submitting Strategies

We will add details on how you can submit strategies in the coming days. This will also be posted about in the [Facebook event for this project](https://www.facebook.com/events/1478033372385341).
